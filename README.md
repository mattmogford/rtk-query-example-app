# RTK Query Example App

This is an example app to demonstrate adding basic tests to a simple [RTK Query][rtk-query] implementation.

## Tests

- The test script [here][service-tests] provides an approach for adding basic tests to your RTK Query service. The tests cover success and error scenarios a query endpoint and a mutation endpoint.
- The test script [here][hooks-tests] provides an approach for adding tests for your RTK Query service's automatically generated React hooks.
- There are some [other tests][tests-dir] which demonstrate testing basic redux functionality like selectors and actions.

## Prerequisites

Install dev requirements by running `yarn` in the project root.

## Running the tests

In the project root run `yarn test`.

## Starting the app

This project includes a very primitive applcation which exercises the RTK Query implementation. The implementation uses [MSW][msw] as a mock service. You can alter the behavior of the mock service [here][handlers]

In the project root run `yarn start`. The application will be available on port 3000 by default
